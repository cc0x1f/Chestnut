# Running

To run Binalyzer, you should use Python 3.8 (versions 3.9 - 3.11 should also work, but were not tested; version 3.12 will **NOT** work).

First, create an environment and install the requirements:

```bash
$ python3.8 -m venv venv
$ python3.8 -m ensurepip --upgrade
$ python3.8 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
